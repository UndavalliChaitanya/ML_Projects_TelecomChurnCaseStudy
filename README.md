# ML_Projects_TelecomChurnCaseStudy

## Business Understanding:
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

**Business Objective:** To predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months

## Steps followed through out the case study:
* Importing necessary libraries
* Inspecting the Dataframe and deriving features
* Filtering high-value customers in the good phase basing on average recharge amount
* Tagging churners basing on below attributes and removing attributes of the churn phase
* Preprocessing Data
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Predicting the churn using Principal Component Analysis
* Model Building
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees and hyper-parameter tuning
* Random Forests and hyper-parameter tuning
* Summary
